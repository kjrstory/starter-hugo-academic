 abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed for the case 3 of the EFD-CFD workshop. Solvers were used for three commercial CFD codes(Star-CCM+, Fluent and CFX) and an open source CFD code(SU2). The grid were generated four types depending on the total cells using commercial grid generation code(Pointwise). Mach number of 0.4 and 0.8, 2 degree angle of attack and Mach number of 0.9, 1 degree angle of attack were calculated. Similar pressure coefficient curve and normal force coefficient were showed from the coarse grid to fine grid of four codes. But there is a difference in the drag coefficient. The position of the shock wave was predicted forward as the discretization order increased in calculations using Star-CCM+ and Fluent. The computation time to converge, Fluent, Star-CCM +, CFX are in order, and SU2 takes much time to converge.},
