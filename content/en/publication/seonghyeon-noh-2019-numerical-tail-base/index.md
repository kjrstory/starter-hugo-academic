abstract: 
 Recently, research on projectiles with wings for precision guidance is actively underway. In this study, we analyzed how the tail fins attached to the projectile affect the base drag. Aerodynamic analysis was performed with RANS(Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) equations using FLUENT, a commercial CFD(Computational Fluid Dynamics) code. Through the aerodynamic analysis, the base drag characteristics of the projectile by parameters (number, length, thickness, position, shape of tail fin) were investigated. The results of this study are expected to be applicable to aerodynamic design of tail fins mounted on projectiles.'
