 abstract = {Fluid-structure interaction analysis was performed to predict a time of wing deployment using eleatic force and centrifugal force. The Fluent for flow domain and ANSYS-Mechanical for structure domain were applied for fluid-structure interaction simulations. The loosely coupling method exchange force and displacement between two solvers each other at every coupling iteration. The structure alone analysis results showed that the wing's elastic force, inertia and centrifugal force were well reflected. Fluid structure interaction analysis results showed that the shock wave generated at cavity in front of wings affected the wing deployment time. In addition, pressure field on each wing varied depending on the angle of attack, which caused each wing to have different deployment time.},
