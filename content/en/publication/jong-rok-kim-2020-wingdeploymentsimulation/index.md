abstract: Fluid-structure interaction analysis was performed to predict a time of
  wing deployment using eleatic force and centrifugal force. The Fluent for flow domain
  and ANSYS-Mechanical for structure domain were applied for fluid-structure interaction
  simulations. The loosely coupling method exchange force and displacement between
  two solvers each other at every coupling iteration. The structure alone analysis
  results showed that the wing's elastic force, inertia and centrifugal force were
  well reflected. Fluid structure interaction analysis results showed that the shock
  wave generated at cavity in front of wings affected the wing deployment time. In
  addition, pressure field on each wing varied depending on the angle of attack, which
  caused each wing to have different deployment time.
