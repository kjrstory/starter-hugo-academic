abstract: We investigate the slat noise generation mechanism by using large-eddy simulation
  (LES) and simple source modeling based on linearized Euler equations. An incompressible
  LES of an MD 30P30N three-element airfoil in the high-lift configuration is conducted
  at Rec = 1.7× 10$^6$. Using the total derivative of the hydrodynamic pressure (DP/Dt)
  acquired from the incompressible LES, representative noise sources in the slat cove
  region are characterized in terms of simple sources such as frequency-specific monopoles
  and dipoles. Acoustic radiation around the 30P30N multi-element airfoil is effectively
  computed using the Brinkman penalization method incorporated with the linearized
  Euler equation. The directivity pattern of p'textsubscriptrms at r = 20ctextsubscriptslat
  in the multiple sources is closely compared to that obtained by the application
  of the LES/Ffowcs-Williams and Hawking's methods to the entire flow field. The power
  spectrum of p' at θ = 290° is in good agreement with the data reported in BANC-III,
  especially the broadband part of the spectrum with a decaying slope $∝$ f textsuperscript-3.
