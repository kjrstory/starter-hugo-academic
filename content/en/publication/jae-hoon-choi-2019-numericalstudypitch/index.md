abstract: This paper presents the computations of the pitch dynamic stability derivatives
  for a projectile with spinning tail fins. The Basic Finner model is chosen to compare
  the rotating effect of tail fins. Three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
  computational fluid dynamics calculations were performed to simulate forced harmonic
  pitch motion of projectile and rotating motion of its tail fins simultaneously.
  Numerical results were compared with computational results for tail-fixed cases.
  The results indicate that the rotation of tail fins decrease pitch damping force
  coefficients and increase pitch damping moment coefficients significantly. The results
  also show that the pitch dynamic stability derivatives are strongly affected by
  rotating speed of tail fins in the subsonic and transonic regimes.
